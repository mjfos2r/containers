# Michael Foster's Container Repository.

A work in progress to centralize all of my docker containers in one repo.

This is where general use containers will go and one off containers for tools otherwise not involved in pipelines elsewhere. In the latter case, the containers will be defined and tracked in those repos. I still might centralize them here via submodules? Not sure.
